Apache JMeter is an Apache project that can be used as a load testing tool for analyzing and measuring the performance of a variety of services, with a focus on web applications. Here we used the JMeter tool to test two different ecommerce websites load/performance testing.

Here we used ecommerce websites Amazon.com for their load testing performance. For the websites we set 100 users thread group with 5 seconds ramp-up time period. Basically, the ramp-up period tells JMeter how long to take to "ramp-up" to the full number of threads chosen. Here 10 threads are used, and the ramp-up period is 5 seconds, then JMeter
will take 5 seconds to get all 100 threads up and running. Each thread will start 25 (100/5) seconds after the previous thread was begun. If there are 30 threads and a ramp-up period of 120 seconds, then each successive thread will be delayed by 4 seconds.
Ramp-up needs to be long enough to avoid too large a work-load at the start of a test, and short enough that the last threads start running before the first ones finish (unless one wants that to happen).

By default, the thread group is configured to loop once through its elements. For Amazon.com ecommerce
website we test different pages. Homepage, Today's Deals, Cart Page,Category page: Smart Home/Television and SLP: Search listing Page.
Here we use an assertion named response assertion script. We used it because, while testing performance of
websites/ web applications we would want to verify the pages are functioning as expected. But sometimes the
page is too huge for the JMeter test client to download, or sometimes we are not concerned about the contents
of the response page, rather we just want to make sure the page is delivered. So here we used response code
is 200 which means OK.
